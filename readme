This is a simple URL shortener project made entirely in Go

This project doesnot use any external Database like MongoDB, SQL etc

This project uses a runtime Database Structure i have built using the Struct

As long as the server is running it will save all data in the struct

As soon as the server is turned off all the data in the database struct will be erased

This project is just for my learning purpose on how we can short URL from a given long URL
